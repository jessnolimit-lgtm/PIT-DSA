this is a our Data Structure and Algirith PIT which is a stack and queue, with a simple interactive UI that you can apply the operations of a stack and queue. This UI contains buttons and kanang naay animations gamay like pop animation and to use it , the operation of a stack you can just simply add elements it can be character or a int because stack doesnt care of which type of data type, it only follows the LIFO behavior And also it has peek functions that u can jsut peek the top element . and for the Queue still can you do the Queueing operations with the buttons and you can also peek the front element. 

DAY(1)
In my first day of making this i planned of what layout or what design of the UI i make so i browse in the yt for many hours just to find my reference and still i can't pick up one so i planned by myself and i decided that i will make it in react for the better UI and in order to make it looks modern and a side panel so the operations in the panel and in the right space is where the stack and queue seen so it can be visualize.

DAY(2)
In my second day i set up my react prjects and i am noot good at react so i set it up first , i dont have that much knowledge of react so i struggle setting it up like installing dependencies and some json files that i cant figure out whats missing so i take a break.

DAY(3)
I still setting it up because i cant figure out whats the error of it so i ask helo in ai so it became less hassle to me , then i alreadg figure it out but i cant process the code first although i know the logiv of it and i take a rest.

Day(4)
I already have my UI but it looks off and so many bugs and for many hours i cant figure it out so i ask ai to modify my code but theres no animations.


Day(5)
in day 5 i already have the UI but there is so much bugs then suddenly my UI doesnt working so for many hours i fix it and after that i figure it out, akways the missing dependencies.

DAY(6)
I still fixing bugs and modifying it but my UI looks odd and ugly so i think about it and figure out that i can use web app to make an ui just a drag and drop and convert it into tsx so i made it and my ui looks better 

DAY(7)
Im working in my Backend and still there is some bugs like the buttonns do not work and im still thinking about it.

Day(8)
Im struggling so i decide that i ask ai about it , but i cant understand what ai always give to me and it cause so many erros so i build my backend in python and API but i dint have that much knowledge in API so i make a pure python stack and queue program and ask ai to convert it into js.

DAY(9)
I already made it , it is very simple yet it follows the principle of stack and queue so i planned to push it in my git so i did it.

DAY(9)
It is already in my repository but sir jef wants the UI that accesible or he can use it so i plan again to deplpy it in netlify.

DAY(9)
this day i struggle the most because there is so much error deploying my project so i redo the file structure and fix it

DAY(10)
so in this day i still figuring it out whats the problem for many hours and still cant figure it out

DAY(11)
so in this day i alredy figure it out and add a netlify file into my project and its missing only build commands

Annd the following day i still thinking modifications about iit...
